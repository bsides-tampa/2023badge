Solution:
  This particular puzzle has two different parts to it; the first is that the image is clearly
glitched. This is usually an indication that the file has been modified in some way. In this
Particular case, we can assume that something has been hidden in the file.

If we reopen this file in our hex editor again, we can scroll further down (since the glitching
is concentrated at the end of the image) and we see the following text has been injected into
the hex of the image:

Yer nearing the finish,
Yer abABBABut at the end.

Solve this last cipher,
Then a message you'll send.

abABBABut bsides tampa,
And yer favorite thing here.

With any suggestions,
Ye've got fer next year.



Description:
  This text hidden in the image was meant to give clues on how to solve the image itself, which
by now you've probably realized is not just binary as it would seem...
