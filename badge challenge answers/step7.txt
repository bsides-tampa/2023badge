Solution:
  The key here was the word "abABBABut" which appeared twice in the poem found in the hex of
the image. This text indicates a Baconian cipher, which uses a series of As and Bs (or 1s and
0s) in place of specific letters as a form of steganography.

Applying the Baconian cipher to the 1s and 0s would reveal the email address:

key@bsidestampa.net

This was the actual ending of the badge challenge, however when you emailed this address two
things would happen:

1. Myself and others would receive the email you sent so we could confirm that you had won
The challenge and so we would know who the first winners were (and could award them the uber
badges as their prize)

2. It would send an "out of office" auto-reply back. The auto-reply message would read:

I am 0ut of the 0ffice right now, However sh0uld you need to re@ch me regarding 1nputs, you
can always call my C3LLULAR phone at: (248)434-5508
THanks.

This was sent as a joke to make people think the challenge wasn't quite done yet. I'll let
call the number yourself for the full experience.
