We had a few people request a writeup on the badge challenge since they were either unable to
participate or simply got stuck, so these files were made to go through it step by step and
dive into how to solve each step. They have been broken out into steps, showing how to solve
the last challenge and a description of the next one so that you'll have a chance to attempt
(some of) them yourself before having the answers spoiled.

I had a blast designing these badges, and just as much fun designing this challenge, so I hope
you all enjoyed it too. Knowing that no one was able to complete the challenge, I feel like this
was a failure on my part, but I learned a lot from this years badge and hope to do another badge
challenge next year - I'll just make sure to plan more time for testing it out to ensure it can
be completed in less time :P

I hope you enjoy this writeup and please reach out to me on twitter if you have any questions
or things you'd like to see more of in future challenges!
