Solution:
  theCove was using WEP encryption which has many issues, hence why it's not used much anymore.
The main issue is that if enough packets are captured (and thus IVs are captured) the password
can be cracked very easily. This can be done using the following steps:

1. Using a wireless card in monitor mode, run airodump-ng targeting "theCove" and capture some
packets. If there's not much traffic, things like deauth attacks can force clients off of the
AP, making them reconnect which can generate traffic.

2. Use aircrack-ng against the capture file created in step 1. Aircrack-ng will use statistical
attacks to determine the key stream and the WEP key.

Since WEP keys can only contain hex characters and must be either 10, 26, or 58 digits long, the
possible combinations are extremely limited, making cracking the keys even easier.

If you didn't have or didn't know how to use aircrack-ng, another option would be to simply
google walkthroughs on creating WEP networks as most suggest the password that was used:

Description:
  Once you were on theCove, you could scan the network with any network scanning tool and you
Would find that there was only one host on the network and it only had port 80 open; indicating
A web server.

Browsing to the IP address of the server would reveal a website which is duplicated at:
