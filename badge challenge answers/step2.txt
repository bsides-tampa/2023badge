Solution:
  This hint was encoded with the pigpen cipher. When decoded, it reads:

Crack the air
To enter theCove
Find ye their
A treasure trove

This hint was meant to indicate that you'd need to use aircrack-ng to get onto a wireless
network being broadcast in the con area called "theCove"



Description:
  Again, this puzzle cannot be put into a text file. This was done on a raspberry pi, so
If I can find a good/simple way to upload the image for this I will, but likely you'll
just have to read through this one if you weren't able to do it at the con.
