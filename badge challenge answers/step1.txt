Solution:
  The text was rot13 encoded, when its decoded it says:

If adventure’s yer fancy Or swag be yer pursuit Search the four corners And set sail on the route

This hint was meant to lead you to inspect the 4 corners of your badge, where you would find
some more encoded text.



Description:
  This text was not any font or text based puzzle, so I'm not able to post the encoded text 
in a text file; you'll just have to go look at your badge to see this one.
